## Plan & Review (based on prompts from YouTube AI Jason)

### Before starting work
- Always in plan mode to make a plan
- After you get the plan, make sure to write the plan to tasks/TASK_NAME.md
- The plan should be a detailed implementation plan, including reasoning behind it as well as tasks broken down.
- If the task requires external knowledge or certain package, research deeply to get latest knowledge. Use Task tool for researching
- Don't over plan, prefer MVP unless instructed otherwise
- Once you have a plan, present it for review. Do not continue without my approval

### While implementing
- Internally update the plan as you work
- After you complete successfully a task in the plan, you should update and append detailed descriptions of the changes, in order to keep a changelog, so following tasks can be easily handed over
