# Architecture Decision Records

Key decisions that should not be re-debated without new information. Check before proposing architecture changes.

## How to Use

- Before proposing a technology change, check if it contradicts an active decision below
- If a decision should change, present the case with: what changed, why the old decision no longer holds, tradeoffs of switching
- Mark decisions as "Superseded" (never delete) with a pointer to the new decision

## Decisions

| Decision | Date | Project | Context | Status |
|----------|------|---------|---------|--------|
| *(add entries as decisions are made)* | | | | |
