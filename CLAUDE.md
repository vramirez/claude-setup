## Plan & Review (based on prompts from YouTube AI Jason)

### Before starrtng work
- Always in plan mode to make a plan
- The plan should be detailed including reasoning behind it, as well as tasks broken down.
- If the task requires external knowledge or certain package, research deeply to get latest knowledge. Use Task tool for researching
- Don't over plan, prefer MVP
- Once you have a plan, present it. Do not continue without my approval

### While implementing
- Internally update the plan as you work
